# orbit-soundtrack
My first android app that plays the soundtrack to the awesome indie game [Orbit](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ChetanSurpur.Orbit)

# Why make orbit-soundtrack?
I played the game a couple times and used it and was entertained, but ended up being very relaxed listening to the soundtrack. I can take a good nap after launching the Orbit app, except my screen being on kills the battery, and once the screen turns off the App stops playing awesome audio.

# How to Build
This is created and built in [Andriod Studio Arctic Fox 2020.3.1 Patch 2](https://developer.android.com/studio) and written in Java.
